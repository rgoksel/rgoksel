## About Me
Hi, I'm Rabia G√∂ksel Demiray. 

I'm a senior undergraduate Electronics and Communication engineering student at Istanbul Technical University. Also, I am a digital design engineer in T√úBƒ∞TAK Bƒ∞LGEM t√ºtel.
I was a traninee at Ecole42.

I design my modules with Verilog/SysyemVerilog, and I am coding my programs in C. I'm trying to improve myself in digital system design, RISC-V and FPGA.

I did my internships about digital design. I have learned about FPGA, VHDL, Verilog, RISC-V and Matlab in these internships.
In Ecole 42, I learned everything about software, how to develop algorithms, and how to write the code of that algorithm.

Now, I'm working on the design, verification, and optimization process of CPU/GPU modules.
