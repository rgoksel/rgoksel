## About Me
Hi, I'm Rabia G√∂ksel Demiray. Recently, I'm a undergraduate electrical and electronics engineering student at Istanbul Technical Universty. Also, I am a cursor student at Ecole 42 Istanbul for 3 months. I'm coding in C for a while and also trying to learn digital design with verilog and vhdl. I have worked with Python and embedded C with stm32 and arduino before.
