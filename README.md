## About Me
Hi, I'm Rabia G√∂ksel Demiray. 

I'm a senior undergraduate Electronics and Communication engineering student at Istanbul Technical University. Also, I am a traine at Ecole 42 Istanbul for about 1 year. 

I'm coding in Verilog and C. Also I'm trying to learn digital system design, RISC-V and FPGA.

I did my internships about digital design. First one was about FPGA and VHDL, also I worked on making a Matlab project work with VHDL on FPGA. The second was about RISC-V with Verilog.

In Ecole 42, I learned everything about software, how to develop algorithms, and how to write the code of that algorithm.
